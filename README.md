# About

This is repository of my personal website's code base. I made it using create-react-app template.

The idea is to build an API that will aggregate all the information about your blogs, projects, bio, education etc. This data will then be populated using React components into the app. This can reduce a lot of labour updating your website everytime.

My name is Joel Vinay Kumar and I love software engineering❤️
